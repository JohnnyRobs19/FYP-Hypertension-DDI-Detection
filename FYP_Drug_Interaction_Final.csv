Applies to: captopril, candesartan

Using captopril together with candesartan may increase the risk of side effects such as low blood pressure, kidney function impairment, and a condition called hyperkalemia (high blood potassium). In severe cases, hyperkalemia can lead to kidney failure, muscle paralysis, irregular heart rhythm, and cardiac arrest. You may be more likely to develop hyperkalemia while taking these medications if you are elderly, dehydrated, or have kidney disease, diabetes, or advanced heart failure. Regular or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may also increase your risk. It is important that you maintain adequate fluid intake during treatment with these medications. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. Your doctor may already be aware of the risks, but has determined that this is the best course of treatment for you and has taken appropriate precautions and is monitoring you closely for any potential complications. In addition, ask your doctor if it is necessary for you to limit consumption of potassium-rich foods such as tomatoes, raisins, figs, potatoes, lima beans, bananas, plantains, papayas, pears, cantaloupes, mangoes, and potassium-containing salt substitutes. You should seek medical attention if you experience nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, tingling of the hands and feet, feelings of heaviness in the legs, a weak pulse, or a slow or irregular heartbeat, as these may be symptoms of hyperkalemia.

aMILoride  candesartan

Applies to: amiloride, candesartan

Using aMILoride together with candesartan may increase potassium levels in the blood. High levels of potassium can develop into a condition known as hyperkalemia, which in severe cases can lead to kidney failure, muscle paralysis, irregular heart rhythm, and cardiac arrest. You may be more likely to develop hyperkalemia while using these medications if you are elderly, dehydrated, or have kidney disease, diabetes, or advanced heart failure. Regular or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may also increase your risk. It is important that you maintain adequate fluid intake during treatment with these medications, especially if you are using them for prolonged periods. In addition, talk to your doctor to see if you should limit consumption of potassium-rich foods such as tomatoes, raisins, figs, potatoes, lima beans, bananas, plantains, papayas, pears, cantaloupes, mangoes, and potassium-containing salt substitutes. You may need a dose adjustment or more frequent monitoring by your doctor to safely use both medications. You should seek medical attention if you experience nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, tingling of the hands and feet, feelings of heaviness in the legs, a weak pulse, or a slow or irregular heartbeat, as these may be symptoms of hyperkalemia. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.",Moderate,"DESCRIPTION

aMILoride  telmisartan

Applies to: amiloride, telmisartan

Using aMILoride together with telmisartan may increase potassium levels in the blood. High levels of potassium can develop into a condition known as hyperkalemia, which in severe cases can lead to kidney failure, muscle paralysis, irregular heart rhythm, and cardiac arrest. You may be more likely to develop hyperkalemia while using these medications if you are elderly, dehydrated, or have kidney disease, diabetes, or advanced heart failure. Regular or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may also increase your risk. It is important that you maintain adequate fluid intake during treatment with these medications, especially if you are using them for prolonged periods. In addition, talk to your doctor to see if you should limit consumption of potassium-rich foods such as tomatoes, raisins, figs, potatoes, lima beans, bananas, plantains, papayas, pears, cantaloupes, mangoes, and potassium-containing salt substitutes. You may need a dose adjustment or more frequent monitoring by your doctor to safely use both medications. You should seek medical attention if you experience nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, tingling of the hands and feet, feelings of heaviness in the legs, a weak pulse, or a slow or irregular heartbeat, as these may be symptoms of hyperkalemia. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.",Moderate,"DESCRIPTION
